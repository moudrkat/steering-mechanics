"""Auto-discover a vector's intent — what it suppresses/promotes.

Run the vector at a strong scale over the benign prompts and harvest the
concepts it most reliably removes from (and adds to) the model's forming
words. Those become the vector's `avoid` / `target` sets — turning ANY
steering vector into a calibratable one with no hand-labeling. This is the
piece heretic doesn't have: heretic knows a priori it targets refusals;
here the target is discovered from the vector itself.
